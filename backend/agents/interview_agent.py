The candidate responded with this answer (transcribed from voice):
"{answer_text}"

Evaluate their response across these dimensions:
1. Technical Accuracy & Knowledge (0.0 to 1.0)
2. Confidence (0 to 10) - Assess their directness, lack of unnecessary filler words, and assertive phrasing.
3. Way of Representation & Communication (0 to 10) - Structure, clarity, and articulation.
4. Relevance to the question (0 to 10).

Write a conversational, friendly, and brief response (max 2 sentences) acknowledging their answer (like a human interviewer would).
CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT ask any follow-up questions or introduce any new topics, as the next question is already pre-defined and will be asked separately. End with a simple transition phrase like "Let's move on." or "Thank you for sharing that."
