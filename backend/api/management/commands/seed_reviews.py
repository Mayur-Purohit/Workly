    {"rating": 4, "text": "Applied to 12 companies in one afternoon. The one-click apply with stored resume profiles saved me hours of repetitive form filling.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 2, "text": "The platform has potential but some job listings felt outdated. A few companies I applied to had already closed the position weeks ago.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 5, "text": "Between matched me with a startup I never heard of. Three interviews later, I had an offer 40% above my previous salary. Life changing.", "is_featured": True},
    {"rating": 4, "text": "Resume builder is clean and professional. Exported it as PDF and got compliments from two separate recruiters on the formatting.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 3, "text": "Good for experienced developers but entry-level positions are limited. Would appreciate more internship and junior role listings.", "is_featured": False},

    {"rating": 1, "text": "Had trouble with email verification taking too long. Support resolved it eventually but it was frustrating losing two days during active job hunting.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 5, "text": "The coding assessment rounds are well-designed. Much better than the random HackerRank tests other platforms force on you.", "is_featured": True},
    {"rating": 4, "text": "Clean interface with zero clutter. I can actually focus on finding roles instead of being bombarded with irrelevant ads and spam.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 3, "text": "Solid platform overall. The company review section helped me avoid a toxic workplace. Wish more companies had detailed reviews though.", "is_featured": False},

    {"rating": 5, "text": "Built a complete recruitment automation tool using Between's API. The resume analysis endpoint accuracy is genuinely impressive.", "is_featured": True},
    {"rating": 3, "text": "API is reliable and well-documented. Only complaint is the webhook retry policy could be more configurable for high-volume integrations.", "is_featured": False},
